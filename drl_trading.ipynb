Malkiel claimed that: “a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.”.\n","\n","What if instead of monkey, it was Pavlov's dog trained with reinforcement learning to select the optimal portfolio strategy? In this article, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the one used in machine learning, where an agent learns actions in an environment that maximizes their value. The agent learns from the outcomes of its actions, without being explicitly programmed with task-specific rules,\n","\n","The goal of any RL algo, is to find value-maximizing policy (*π*):\n","$$\n","\\pi* = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\n","$$\n","Where *γ (0 ≤ γ ≤ 1)* is the discounting factor to control the agent's rewards, *t* is a timestep and *R* is the returns in that step. The policy in RL is the probability of taking **action *a*** in **state *s***.\n","\n","The algo we will adopt is **Q-Learning**, a model-free RL algorithm, that aims to indirectly learn the policy through the **VALUE** of an action for a discrete state its in, rather the policy itself. It's useful in our case, as it doesn't need to model the environment - in our case, the random capital markets.\n","\n","Estimating the **Q-Value** is done through the Bellman's equation:\n","\n","$$\n","Q^*(s, a) = \\mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q^*(s', a') \\mid s, a]\n","$$\n","\n","These Q-values are placed in the Q-Tables and used by the agent as look-up, to find all possible actions' Q-values from the current state, and choose the action with the highest Q-value (exploitation). This is good within a finite space, but not in a stochastic environment with limitless combinations, a problem which we will solve with our neural-network.\n","\n","This agent designed in this article has been inspired by the paper of *Théate, Thibaut and Ernst, Damien
